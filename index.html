We closed permanently as of 4pm today. Please see the letter below for details. We emailed our closing announcement to all of our patients on January 15. If you didn't receive it, it may be because you opted out of receiving our emails or it went to your junk or spam folder.

Dear Patients,
</p>

<p>As you may be aware, our building was sold to a developer early last year. After finishing negotiations with my new landlord and carefully considering my options, I made the difficult decision to close. While I have really enjoyed having my own clinic, practicing in Stouffville, and taking care of all of you, it has been a tough five years for many reasons, and I was almost always overwhelmed with things to do. Even still, after going through demolition and construction and considering all of the time and effort I put into my business, it was an extremely difficult decision to make.</p>

<p>I am currently on maternity leave. I will post an update here when I start working again so you know where to find me.</p>

<p>I would like to thank you for your business over the past five years. I have really enjoyed taking care of your eyes and getting to know all of you. I wish you all the best. If you have any questions or concerns, you can email me at <a href="mailto:info@oakridgefamilyeyecare.ca">info@oakridgefamilyeyecare.ca</a>.</p>

<p>Take care,</p>
<p>Dr. Jasmintha Ellaurie</p>
